# Rovie
Arduino robot project to demonstrate the ability to self navigate to points provided from an outside source. This is still a work in progress.

Current Issues/Roadmap:
* Motor should be generalized to handle multiple types of motors (i.e. stepper)
* Convert implementation to use stepper motors to help determine speed/distance
* Add connectivity to outside source
* Define spec of data transfer
